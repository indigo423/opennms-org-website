In order to submit your proposal, please go to [OUCE 2016 CFP](http://cfp.opennms.eu/en/ouce2016/cfp/session/new/), register your proposal and make sure you provide valid contact information.
This proposal form is to be used only for your personal proposal.
You have questions regarding the conference, please register the [OUCE mailing list](http://lists.opennms.eu/mailman/listinfo/ouce), where you can get in contact with the organization team.

After the review period, ending **August 31st**, you will get notified if your proposal is accepted.
Please take notice of our policies as well.
Among some other things we assume that your speech will be contributed under a creative commons license and that you buy in on providing a harassment-free conference environment for everyone.

## Recording

Talks will be recorded and made available on our website after the conference (unless you tell us that youâ€™d prefer not to be made public).
All recordings will be available without any special logins.
