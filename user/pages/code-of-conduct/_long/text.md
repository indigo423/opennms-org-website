### Harassment

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### Exhibitors & Sponsors

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

### Participants

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately.
Event staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
We value your attendance.

### Venue & Social Events

We expect participants to follow these rules at all related venues and social events.
